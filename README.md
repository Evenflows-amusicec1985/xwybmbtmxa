OMG, just finished watching Raid 2 and I'm like, WOW ðŸ˜… Seriously, the choreography is just insane! It's like they decided to one-up the first one by just throwing endless punches and kicks. My couch feels like it's still vibrating from all that action, you know? And hey, the scenes inside the prisonâ€”crazy intense! I kinda felt claustrophobic just sitting there. Also, the mud wrestling dudes part was kind of... something else, haha.

Man, if I ever download the movie again, Iâ€™ll probably skip that part. It's like they tried to cram in every martial arts move ever invented, like, save some for the sequel, guys, chill. And did you catch that fight in the kitchen?ðŸ¤¯ I think I forgot to breathe for a second. Makes you wanna be a kitchen ninja. Itâ€™s like, why canâ€™t my cooking be that intense?

> And the storyline, right? Itâ€™s like, yeah okay, let's give our guy another stupidly impossible mission. Cause why not? It's not like the guy needed just one peaceful day, right? ðŸ˜‚ But hey, who am I to ~judge~?? You start wondering if they just woke up one day and were like, Let's make it extra extra with a side of extra. It's a mood, can't lie. It's gonna be one of those I'll have to watch the movie again at some point, not just for the actionâ€”really, the whole thing feels like a crazy adrenaline shot.

Also, they had some characters that felt like they were straight out of a comic book. Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man? Real original, guys. Still, you kinda gotta respect the extra-ness.

console.log(What the hell is this?! Anyway, back to the movie)

But anyway, I'll take the mayhem over another romantic comedy any day! ðŸ˜‚ Kinda tired now though, feels like I just survived the ultimate fight club. Mixed feelings but definitely worth staying up. Would you ever do karate after seeing all that or nah?
